    <b>WARNING MAY CAUSE SEIZURES</b>

    <p></p>

A very small percentage of people may experence a seizure when expose to certain visual images, including flashing lights or patters that may appear in video games. <b>If you or any of your relative have a history of seizures or epilepsy, DO NOT continue.</b>

    <p></p>

    <b>In order to maximize your bonus, read carefully the instructions.</b>
    <p></p>
<p> You will be asked to perform a task which will probe your working memory capacity. It's been reported in the scientific literature that working memory capacity its highly correlated with IQ. Upon experiment termination, you will be told by email how was your performance relative to all the other participants. Do not feel demotivated if it gets too difficult as the number items or delay duration increase,  it's supposed to be difficult. Nevertheless, remember that you get more money when answering correctly the difficult trials.
</p>

<b>Short summary</b><p></p>

<p>
You will be briefly shown a set of colored circles at random locations. At the end of each trial, you will be asked to report the color of <b>one of the circles</b> by using your mouse to pick a color from a color wheel. The best strategy is to focus on the black box and avoid looking directly at the circles. This will ensure you will attend to all the circles equally. 

<p>
More detailed instructions will follow. On the following screens, you will see a simulation of the kind of trials you can expect to encounter. Each page corresponds to a step on the real HIT but bare in mind that in the real HIT they will happend one of after the other with no pause except at the end of each trial, while waiting for your answer. 
</p>

<b>Final test</b><p></p>

<p>
Finally, before the actual HIT you will see a small set of very easy trials. Feel free to try out until you understand how the task works before going for real money.
